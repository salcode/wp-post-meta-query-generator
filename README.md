# WordPress Post Meta Query Builder

WordPress defines the [wp_postmeta database table](https://codex.wordpress.org/Database_Description#Table:_wp_postmeta) in a way that is very powerful but also challenging to query at times.

Specifically, creating a database query that returns the post meta information with keys as columns and each row sharing the same post_id.

This project helps me generate these queries quickly.

Built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
